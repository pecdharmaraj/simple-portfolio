                 <h3>I'm a Programmer.</h3>
                 <p>Seriously I am very much afraid of the word Programming in 12<sup>th</sup> standard . After that I am started to concentrate
                 in programming . I'm able to solve programs in c , c++ and python . Among this python is my favourite because it is easy to code unlike c .
                  Now I'm studying B.TECH degree in ECE and I took minors in CSE . I really interested to get in to software company . I will work hard to
                 get in Software Company .<br><br>
                 By the mean time we need to focus on projects also because it gives working experience . I have a experience in machine learning ,
                 web scarping ,SQL database ,Cho Han gambling game in python ,Image processing in open-cv . Currently we are working on to build 
                 a drone which can detect enemy drone and report to us . For this object detection concept is very important , by python 
                 it can done easier .</p>
